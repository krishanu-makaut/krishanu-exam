Git is a distributed version control system that allows software developers to collaborate on the same project from different locations. Developers can push their code to a remote repository like GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket, where others can access it using pull or clone commands.
Each developer works on their own branch, adds or updates features, and later merges their changes into the main branch. Git keeps a history of all changes, who made them, and when. This helps in tracking progress and avoiding mistakes.
It also supports pull requests, which allow team members to review each otherâ€™s code before merging. If two people work on the same file, Git helps in resolving conflicts.
Thus, Git makes teamwork easier, organized, and efficient over the internet.
